# From PEP 517:
# Some backends may have extra requirements for creating sdists, such as
# version control tools. However, some frontends may prefer to make
# intermediate sdists when producing wheels, to ensure consistency. If the
# backend cannot produce an sdist because a dependency is missing, or for
# another well understood reason, it should raise an exception of a specific
# type which it makes available as UnsupportedOperation on the backend object.

# When this file is used directly as a backend (via a specially crafted wheel
# that contains only this module), that should only be because it's been
# installed and invoked by an installer (such as Pip) for the express purpose
# of creating a wheel from an sdist (of some other project) from PyPI.
# In these circumstances, something has gone wrong if any attempt is made
# at all to build an sdist.

# The "main" code implements a build_sdist hook and only uses this file
# for wheel-specific functionality.
